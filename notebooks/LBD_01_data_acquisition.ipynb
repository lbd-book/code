    "The function `load_data_from_pubmed` was developed to retrieve and process text data from PubMed, a widely used database for biomedical literature. The function retrieves articles based on a search term and date range, extracts relevant information (such as titles and abstracts) and then formats this data into a list of strings. This functionality is of great importance for LBD, as access to large, domain-specific data sets is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Initializing the PubMed article retriever*:\n",
    "   The function begins by creating an instance of `PubMedArticleRetriever`, a tool for querying PubMed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Performing a PubMed search*:\n",
    "   The function searches PubMed for articles matching the specified criteria:\n",
    "   - *Search term*: The `search_str` parameter specifies the query (e.g., keywords or phrases).\n",
    "   - *Date range*: The `min_date` and `max_date` parameters define the publication date range for the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Retrieving PMIDs*:\n",
    "   The function extracts PubMed IDs (PMIDs) for the articles found in the search:\n",
    "   - *PMIDs*: Unique identifiers for PubMed articles, used to fetch detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Fetching article details*:\n",
    "   The function retrieves the detailed information (title and abstract) for each article:\n",
    "   - *Title and abstract extraction*: The function extracts and stores the title and abstract for each article, handling cases where the abstract might be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Converting to a List of strings*:\n",
    "   The extracted data is then converted into a list of formatted strings using the `convert_dict_to_list` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmatic access to and processing of PubMed data enables researchers to automate the retrieval of large volumes of biomedical literature, saving time and ensuring a comprehensive data set. This is essential for conducting thorough literature searches or for training machine learning models on domain-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Biomedical research*: Automate the search for relevant studies for systematic reviews or meta-analyzes.\n",
    "- *Drug discovery*: Collect literature on specific compounds or diseases to identify potential new drug targets.\n",
    "- *Scientific writing*: Collect a large number of references on a specific topic to review or cite in scientific papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this function, enter a search term, a date range and a domain name. The function will return a list of formatted strings containing the titles and abstracts of the articles retrieved from PubMed. This list can then be used for further analysis, e.g. text mining, summarization or other LBD tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to retrieve articles from PubMed about *migraine* and *magnesium* in the title or abstract, from the year 1988, with the domain name *mig_mag* (stored in the line as *!mig_mag*), the call of the function is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = load_data_from_pubmed('migraine[tiab] AND magnesium[tiab]', '1988/01/01', '1988/12/31', 'mig_mag')\n",
