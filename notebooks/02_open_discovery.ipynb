    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after his groundbreaking study on the effects of fish oil on Raynaud's disease, Swanson (1988) applied the same research methodology to explore the role of magnesium in migraine disorders. He observed that a lack of magnesium might exacerbate migraines due to various factors including stress, spreading cortical depression, epilepsy, platelet aggregation, serotonin and substance P levels, inflammation, vasoconstriction, prostaglandin formation, and hypoxia. However, the capability of magnesium to inhibit calcium channels could potentially prevent migraine episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates the open discovery setting. Open discovery fundamentally serves as a method for generating new hypotheses. This process can be described using Swanson's (1986) ABC model: Suppose the research begins with a term, 'c', with 'C' representing the body of literature associated with 'c'. Assume that domain 'A' comprises literature that may reveal previously unknown connections to 'C'. The aim is to identify 'A'. According to Swanson, this involves navigating\n",
    "\n",
    "> through some intermediate literature (B) toward an unknown destination A. The success of this endeavor relies entirely on the knowledge and creativity of the researcher...\n",

    "## MeSH ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "[MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_record_types.html) contains three basic types of MeSH Records:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Descriptors* characterize the subject matter or content. This record type plays a central role in MeSH vocabulary as a unit of indexing and retrieval. With the exception of Class 3 descriptors (see below), all descriptors are organised into a numbered tree structure or hierarchy that allows users to browse in a orderly fashion from broader to narrower topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Qualifiers* are used with descriptors and afford a means of grouping together those documents concerned with a particular aspect of a subject. There are 78 topical Qualifiers (also known as Subheadings) used for indexing and cataloging in conjunction with Descriptors. Qualifiers afford a convenient means of grouping together those citations which are concerned with a particular aspect of a subject. For example, Liver/drug effects indicates that the article or book is not about the liver in general, but about the effect of drugs on the liver Qualifiers are searchable in PubMed as MeSH Subheadings (SH field).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Supplementary Concept Records* (SCRs) are used to index chemicals, drugs, and other concepts such as rare diseases for MEDLINE and are searchable by Substance Name field (NM) in PubMed. Unlike Descriptors, SCRs are not organised in a tree hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are divided into four classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Main Headings* (Class 1).\n",
    "These records are topical headings that are used to index citations in NLM's MEDLINE database, for cataloging of publications, and other databases, and are searchable in PubMed as [MH]. Most Descriptors indicate the subject of an indexed item, such as a journal article, that is, what the article is about. Descriptors are generally updated on an annual basis but may, on occasion, be updated more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Publication Characteristics* (Class 2).\n",
    "These records indicate what the indexed item is, i.e., its genre, rather than what it is about, for example, Historical Article. They may include Publication Components, such as Charts; Publication Formats, such as Editorial; and Study Characteristics, such as Clinical Trial. They function as metadata, rather than being about the content. These records are searchable in PubMed as Publication Type [PT], and the terms in MEDLINE records are labeled as \"PT\" or <PublicationType> rather than \"MH\" or <MeSHHeading>. They are listed in category V of the MeSH Tree Structures. A list is available of Publication Types, with Scope Notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Check Tags* (Class 3).\n",
    "This class of descriptors is used solely for tagging citations that contain certain categories of information. They do not appear in the MeSH tree. Modernization has largely eliminated the need for the data type and many of the Check Tags have been changed to Class 1 headings that can be used either a MH or a Check Tag. Currently only two Class 3 descriptors remain: \"Male\" and \"Female\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Geographics* (Class 4).\n",
    "Descriptors which include continents, regions, countries, states, and other geographic subdivisions. They are not used to characterize subject content but rather physical location. They are listed in category Z of the MeSH Tree Structures."
