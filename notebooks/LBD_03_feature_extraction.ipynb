    "This function create_bag_of_words takes a list of preprocessed text documents as input and uses the scikit-learn library \n",
    "to create a bag of words representation of the corpus. \n",
    "The function first creates an instance of the sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer, \n",
    "which is an implementation of the bag of words model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then fits the vectorizer to the input corpus and transforms the corpus into a bag of words matrix using \n",
    "the vectorizer.fit_transform() method. The matrix is stored in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format (csr_matrix) \n",
    "for efficient storage and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the CountVectorizer instance and the bag of words matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python function, `create_bag_of_words`, generates a Bag of Words (BoW) representation of a text corpus. The function takes in a list of preprocessed text documents and converts them into a matrix where each row represents a document, and each column represents a word or a sequence of words (n-grams) found in the corpus. The matrix entries indicate the frequency of these words within the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words model is a foundational technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining. It transforms text data into a structured numerical format that machine learning models can process. This is particularly crucial for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. The ability to convert text into a quantifiable form allows for more sophisticated analysis and discovery, such as identifying patterns, trends, or novel insights in a large corpus of literature—commonly referred to as Literature-Based Discovery (LBD).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of LBD, the BoW model can be used to extract significant terms from scientific papers, patents, or other textual data. By analyzing the frequency and distribution of words across a corpus, researchers can identify new connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information. This can lead to the discovery of novel hypotheses or previously overlooked relationships between concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Input parameters*:\n",
    "    - `corpus`: A list of preprocessed text documents. Each document is expected to be a string where preprocessing (such as lowercasing, removing punctuation, etc.) has already been applied.\n",
    "    - `ngram_size`: Specifies the maximum size of n-grams to consider. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of `n` items from a given text. For example, with `ngram_size=2`, the function will consider both single words (unigrams) and pairs of words (bigrams).\n",
    "    - `min_df`: Sets a threshold for ignoring infrequent words. Words that appear in fewer documents than this threshold will be ignored. This can be a count (e.g., `min_df=2` means words must appear in at least two documents) or a proportion (e.g., `min_df=0.01` means words must appear in at least 1% of the documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Return values*:\n",
    "    - A list of words (or n-grams) that are the features of the BoW model.\n",
    "    - A matrix where each row corresponds to a document and each column corresponds to a word (or n-gram). The values in the matrix represent the frequency of the word in the corresponding document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Example Usage*:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    corpus = [\n",
    "        \"natural language processing with python\",\n",
    "        \"text mining and information retrieval\",\n",
    "        \"introduction to natural language processing\",\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "    words, bow_matrix = create_bag_of_words(corpus, ngram_size=1, min_df=1)\n",
    "    print(\"Words:\", words)\n",
    "    print(\"Bag of Words Matrix:\\n\", bow_matrix)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Text classification*: Convert documents into BoW format for input into machine learning models to classify them into categories like spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic classification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Document similarity*: Compute the similarity between documents based on their BoW representations, useful in information retrieval and clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Feature extraction for NLP tasks*: Use BoW as a feature set for more complex NLP tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, or word sense disambiguation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_bag_of_words` function is a simple yet powerful tool to transform text data into a structured numerical format. This transformation is a critical first step in many text mining and NLP tasks, enabling more advanced analysis and discovery processes. Whether you’re conducting sentiment analysis, categorizing documents, or exploring new hypotheses through Literature-Based Discovery, understanding and using the BoW model is essential."
